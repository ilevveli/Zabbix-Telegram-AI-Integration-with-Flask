# Zabbix-Telegram-AI-Integration-with-Flask
In this project, I created an automated system that integrates Zabbix monitoring alerts with Telegram and OpenAI's GPT-4 via a Flask server. This setup allows Zabbix alerts to trigger AI-generated responses that are sent directly to a Telegram chat, providing smart recommendations based on alert messages.
